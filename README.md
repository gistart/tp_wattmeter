# TP Wattmeter

![demo](/screenshot.png?raw=true "demo")

Forked from https://bitbucket.org/blackBriar/wattmeter and https://github.com/luispabon/gnome-shell-battery-time-and-percentage

Simple extension to show current power consumption in Gnome battery widget.

Differs from original wattmeter -- it reads directly from `/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/power_now`.

Tested with ThinkPad Carbon X1 Gen4
